                    <a href="hedgehog.html">DNS-STATS:Hedgehog</a> is a visualisation tool for DNS statistics that consumes data acquired with the 
                    <a href="http://dns.measurement-factory.com/tools/dsc/">DSC</a> collector. <br/> Hedgehog was initially developed for 
                    <a href="http://www.icann.org/">ICANN</a> by <a href="http://sinodun.com/">Sinodun IT</a> and is now released open 
                    source under the Apache License, version 2.0. For more information on the development and support of DNS-STATS:Hedgehog see 
                    the <a href="http://dns-stats.org/">dns-stats</a> website.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Plots</strong>
                        <ul class="discs">
                            <li>The paradigm in Hedgehog is that the user selects a set of criteria (plot, time window, 
                                plot type and node selection) and then hits the 'Generate Plot!' button. (It is not the case
                                that changing e.g. the plot or node selection immediately re-generates the current plot.)</li>
                            <li>The static plots are .png files. Hedgehog offers the option to view these plots as normal
                                line plots, stacked line plots or line plots with a logarithmic y-axis.</li>
                            <li>The interactive plots are based on GoogleViz and provide zoom controls (fixed intervals 
                                at the top left and a slider bar at the bottom) and display data values along the top as the
                                user moves their mouse over the plot window.</li>
                            <li>Plots are cached as they are viewed. The 'day' plots (midnight-midnight) for the previous
                                day are cached overnight.</li>
                            <li>For line plots of less than or equal to one day interval the data points are 1 minute 
                                apart by default. Where the time interval is greater than 1 day the data is averaged to improve
                                the appearance of the plot. These averaged plots contain a fixed number of data points which 
                                results in the interval between the data points being 7 minutes for a 'week' plot and ~30 minutes
                                for a 'month' plot.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="discs">
                            <li>The basic time controls generate graphs for fixed intervals. 
                                <ul class="circles">
                                    <li>The '&lt;' and '&gt;' buttons will shift the window forward or backwards by one interval unit.</li>
                                    <li>The '+&lt;' and '&gt;+' buttons will increase the window width by one interval unit. </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The advanced time controls allow the user to specify the time interval down to the minute.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Node selection</strong>
                        <ul class="discs">
                            <li>The nodes are displayed in different tabs for each Group, including an 'All' group. Within each Group the nodes may be further grouped by 
                                either Country/City/Instance or not grouped at all. Within each Group tab bulk selections can be altered with the 'Actions' buttons. 
                                The icons next to the Group/Country/City/Instance names indicate if all (full circle), some (half circle) or none (empty circle) of the nodes
                                in that choice are included in nodes for plot generation. Clicking on an individual Country/City/Instance/Node selects or de-selects that choice. </li>

                    </li>

                             <li>The static link provided below the plot window is a link to a cached version of the plot file on the Hedgehog server. 
                             This link may not be valid if the cache has been flushed since the plot was originally produced.</li>
