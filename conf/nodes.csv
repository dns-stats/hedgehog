######################### NODES CONFIGURATION FILE ###################
# Format is:     server-name, node-name, [node-group],[node-country],
#                [node-city],[node-instance],[node-ip]
# Server name, node name, group and instance fields can contain alphanumeric
# characters, full stops (.) and hyphens (-) only.
# Country and city fields can contain alphanumeric characters, spaces and
# hyphens (-) only.
# Nodes may be grouped and plotted by Country,City or Instance in 2.1.
# '#' is the comment character
# 
# server-name   - This must be unique and it must match the name used in the
#                 data directory path for uploaded files.
# node-name     - This must be unique for a given server and it must 
#                 match the name used in the data directory path for 
#                 uploaded files.
# node-group    - This is used in the node grouping tabs in the Hedgehog
#                 front end. It should be unique for a given server. 
#                 It is optional and if not
#                 specified the node is added to a group called 'Other'.
# node-country  - This is the country that the node is located in
#                 It is optional and if not specified 'No Country' is used.
# node-city     - This is the city that the node is located in
#                 It is optional and if not specified 'No City' is used.
#                 This is used to plot node locations in GEO plots
# node-instance - This is used to collect nodes into subgroups called 'Instances' 
#                 (e.g. nodes within the same city) for convenient selection
#                 and plotting. It should be unique for a given group. It is 
#                 optional and if not specified 'No Instance' is used.
# node-ip       - The management IP address of the node (IPv4 or IPv6)
#                 It is optional and if not specified is left blank. This is 
#                 required if RSSAC load-time/zone-size data is to be collected.
# old-name      - This field indicates that there is either a new name for this
#                 node in the node-name field or if old-name == delete then
#                 it indicates that this node and all associated data should be
#                 deleted. If old-name == node-name or if old-name is not 
#                 present no action related to name change or deletion is taken.
#
