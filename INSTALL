The following instructions describe how to install Hedgehog on Ubuntu 14.04 Server and set up imports of data.

Note: The server and PostgreSQL must both be configured to use UTC!

1. Installation
1.1. Requirements
1.1.1. Platform support

Version 2.0.0b1 of Hedgehog is currently only supported on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Server.

1.1.2. Database support

Hedgehog has been tested with PostgreSQL 9.3.X

1.2. Hedgehog dependencies

1.2.1. Required packages

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:opencpu/rapache
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-core r-base-dev libcairo2-dev libxt-dev r-cran-ggplot2 r-cran-dbi \
                     r-cran-cairodevice r-cran-reshape r-cran-digest postgresql postgresql-client \
                     postgresql-server-dev-9.3 postgresql-contrib pgbouncer libboost-all-dev libtool \
                     libpqxx-dev apache2-mpm-prefork apache2-prefork-dev git libapache2-mod-r-base

1.2.2. Additional R packages

Some R packages are needed that are not available through apt, they can be installed via R.
You will be prompted to choose a mirror site, or you can specify a repo by using a command of the form

install.packages("name", repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')

Install:

sudo R
install.packages(c("brew","Cairo","googleVis","RPostgreSQL","R.utils","yaml"))
q()

If you are prompted to save workspace image y/n/c, choose no.

The package versions that Hedgehog has been tested against are listed below alongside each package.
R Package Supported Version
brew	1.0-6
Cairo	1.5-6
googleVis	0.5.5
RPostgreSQL	0.4
R.utils	1.33.0
yaml	2.1.13

1.3. Install Hedgehog
1.3.1. Install and build code

Download the code from github:

wget https://github.com/dns-stats/hedgehog/archive/2.0.0a1.tar.gz

tar -xzf 2.0.0b1.tar.gz
cd hedgehog-2.0.0b1
./autogen.sh
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
sudo make install
cd

You may notice the following message during the installation step: "Error in find.package(pkgs, lib) : there is no package called ‘RPostgreSQLHelper’ Execution halted". This can be safely ignored.

For large installations it may be preferable to store the data files on a separate partition to the database. See the *User guide for an overview of the Hedgehog directory structure.
In this case you may wish to mount a disk here or make use of a symbolic link at this stage of the installation.

1.3.2. System users and groups

Two system users are required for Hedgehog:
Database owner - this is the user that will own the database created by hedgehog and the top level datafile directories (default user in this example is 'hedgehog')
Read user - this should be the apache user which requires only read access to the database (default apache user in this example is called 'www-data')

# create a system user and group called hedgehog
sudo addgroup --system hedgehog
sudo adduser --system --ingroup hedgehog hedgehog
# put www-data user in group hedgehog
sudo adduser www-data hedgehog
# put hedgehog user in group www-data
sudo adduser hedgehog www-data

1.3.3. Configure Hedgehog

Edit the <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/hedgehog.yaml configuration file to make sure the user names match the users specified in the previous step. 
Also configure the database parameters (port, name) as required. (Note a limitation of 2.0 is that the database and web front end must run on the same machine)

database:
  port         : 5432      # specify port for the postgresql DB.
  name         : hedgehog  # specify dbname for the postgresql DB.
  owner        : hedgehog  # specify an owner for the postgresql DB. This user will also run refile_and_grok
  read_user    : www-data  # specify a read user for the postgresql DB. This is typically the apache user.

! Do not edit the 'directories' section of this file as in 2.0 it is auto-generated.

Note that there is also a sample conf file in the same directory to retrieve default settings: <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/hedgehog.yaml.sample.

Change the ownership of the directory specified below so it is owned by the same user as the database, so for example in a default install:

sudo chown -R hedgehog:hedgehog <prefix>/var/hedgehog/

Also check the parameters in the <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/hedgehog_gui.yaml file, which specifies parameters controlling the behaviour of the web front end. 
See the "Plot Caching" section in the user guide for a more detailed description of when plots are cached.

--- ## YAML config for hedgehog GUI
www:
  default_plot_type           : interactive # static = png plots, interactive = googlevis plots
  use_plot_caching            : 1           # 1 = true: use cached plots when possible, 0 = false: never use cached plots
  caching_delay_in_hours      : 1           # if cache=1 then only plots with an end time earlier than this this number of hours ago
                                            # are cached. More recent plots are not cached as data may still be being imported
  presentation_delay_in_hours : 0           # number of hours behind now for which the GUI will display data

1.3.4. Configure apache

You will probably need to edit the /etc/apache2/apache2.conf file to enable access to the install directory by adding <Directory <prefix>/share/hedgehog> and <Directory <prefix>/var/hedgehog/www> elements.
Depending on your configuration you may want to change the name of the hedgehog.conf file or disable the default site using the following command:

sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf

Add the Hedgehog configuration files to apache and enable the site:

sudo cp <prefix>/share/hedgehog/conf/hedgehog.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/
sudo a2ensite hedgehog.conf

Alter the permissions (add the line 'umask 002' to the apache envvars file):

sudo vi /etc/apache2/envvars
# Enable extra permissions for Hedgehog
umask 002

apache/rapache write some of their logs to user.* so it can be useful to change the syslog config:
sudo vi /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
Uncomment the line beginning 'user.*'. 

Finally, restart apache:

sudo service apache2 restart

1.3.5. Create and populate the database

NOTE: For this version of Hedgehog the servers and nodes to be processed and displayed must be specified manually.

Edit the the <prefix>/etc/hedgehog/nodes.csv to specify the servers, nodes and grouping to be used.
 - Note that the current GUI layout is optimised for nodes with short names (<6 characters) of the same length

Then run the command below noting the following:
- If you have historic data to import then use the -m flag to specify the month of the oldest data that will need importing. Otherwise the database tables will be created to hold data from this month onwards.
- This script assumes there is a default postgres user called 'postgres' (with no password configured) that has sufficient privileges to create databases and users. 
- If the the default postgres user is not called 'postgres' then use the -u parameter to specify the name of the database user to use to create the Hedgehog database
- If the postgres user requires a password, use the -p flag to be prompted to enter the password.
- Note that this script will also create the directory structure for all the specified servers and nodes under the data directory if it does not exist

sudo <prefix>/sbin/hedgehog_database_create.sh

1.3.6. Test the Hedgehog front end

At this point you should be able to see the servers and nodes in the web front end at the URL http://<server-name>/hedgehog

2. Running Hedgehog
2.1. Import data

Hedgehog can process data in the following 3 ways:
Source format     Output format

XML	Database	For real time uploads
DAT	Database	For import of historic data
XML	DAT	For backwards compatibility with DSC

In each case the <prefix>/bin/refile_and_grok.sh script is used, it is simply given different parameters:

> refile_and_grok.sh -h

refile_and_grok - finds all input files in the working directory and processes to output format

-w Working directory to search for input files (default: <prefix>/var/hedgehog/data)
-i Input file format <XML|DAT> (default: XML)
-o Output file format <DAT|DB> (default: DB)
-c Non-interactive mode - use this flag when being run by a cron job
-s Start date from which to process incoming data (XML input only)
-r Disable processing of rssac datasets. Default is to process all datasets.
-R Reserved processors. Number of CPUS processors to exclude from import (default 0).
-h Show this help.

2.1.1. Importing historical .DAT data

sudo -u hedgehog <prefix>/bin/refile_and_grok.sh -i DAT

Be aware that this can take a long time if there is a significant amount of historic data and it may be advisable to run this in stages.

2.1.2. Importing real-time .XML data
2.1.2.1. Manually

This can be done manually by running the refile_and_grok.sh script (consider running this nohup as it may take a while depending on how much data there is to process).

sudo -u hedgehog <prefix>/bin/refile_and_grok.sh

A snapshot of the progress of the data import can be generated by running the command below:

sudo -u hedgehog <prefix>/bin/hedgehog_import_create_summary.sh

2.1.2.2. Automatically

Configure a regular cron job for refile_and_grok.sh as shown below

2.2. Maintenance
2.2.1. Cron jobs

In 2.0 several cron jobs need to be configured. They should run as the 'hedgehog' system user.

sudo -u hedgehog crontab -e

Below is an example crontab for a typical system Note that the hedgehog_manage_partitions_cron.sh script MUST be configured to run at least once a month.
