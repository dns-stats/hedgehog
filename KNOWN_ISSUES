KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS: Hedgehog 2.0.0b2
-----------------------------
* Currently, the database and web front end must run on the same server.

* The full list of possible plots are displayed via the drop down menu in the
  GUI, regardless of whether there is data in the database for the plot

* A configuration option is available (default_interactive_plot_type in 
  hedgehog_gui.yaml) which can specify the system to produce SVG or 
  Flash plots for the interactive plots (google charts). There is a known 
  issue with the SVG plots where long legends are not wrapped properly:
  https://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-api-issues/issues/detail?id=1536
  This affects, for example, the 'Traffic volume' plot. However, we prefer SVG
  to flash given all the flash vulnerabilities of late. 

* The plot is not sorted according to size correctly in the interactive plots
  for horizontal bar charts. The static plots should be used instead. This
  includes:
  - QTYPE for most popular TLD
  - Busient client subnet
  - RCODE by client subnet
  - Root abusers
  - Query classification by subnet

* The y-axis label is not visible on googleviz line charts in Firefox because the
  flex box does not display correctly.

* Support for RSSAC reports is added for XML imports only, however extended 
  RCODES cannot be collected by the existing DSC collector so only base RCODES
  are collected and displayed. If the DSC collector is extended then further
  work must be done in Hedgehog to also support extended RCODES

* The Unique Sources plot is not available until after the RSSAC report has
  been generated for the date in question.

* If a user touches any controls while a query is waiting to return
  then the 'generate graph' button becomes enabled again and a second
  plot can be generated that will then over write the first.
