KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS:
-------------------------

* The full list of possible plots are displayed via the drop down menu in the
  GUI, regardless of whether there is data in the database for the plot

* A configuration option is available (default_interactive_plot_type in 
  hedgehog_gui.yaml) which can specify the system to produce SVG or 
  Flash plots for the interactive plots (google charts). There is a known 
  issue with the SVG plots where long legends are not wrapped properly:
  https://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-api-issues/issues/detail?id=1536
  This affects, for example, the 'by_node' plot. However, we prefer SVG
  to flash given all the flash vulnerabilities of late. 

* Support for RSSAC reports is added for XML imports only, however extended 
  RCODES cannot be collected by the existing DSC collector so only base RCODES
  are collected and displayed. If the DSC collector is extended then further
  work must be done in Hedgehog to also support extended RCODES

* The Unique Sources plot is not available until after the RSSAC report has
  been generated for the date in question.

* If a user touches any controls while a query is waiting to return
  then the 'generate graph' button becomes enabled again and a second
  plot can be generated that will then over write the first.

* No static plots are produced for the GEO type plots.The geochart is ignoring 
  the instruction in the html not to show the color code in the tooltips.

* Server, node and group and instance names may only contain alphanumeric 
  characters, full stops (.) and hyphens (-). Country and city names can
  only contain alphanumeric characters, spaces and hyphens (-)
  
* The Busiest client locations by city plot does't support passing the required
  API key to the script element - see
